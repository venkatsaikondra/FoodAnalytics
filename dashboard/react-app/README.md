# Food Delivery — React front-end

This is a minimal React app scaffold placed in `dashboard/react-app`.

What I added
- Basic React app files under `src/`.
- `NavBar` component with links: Home, Sign In, Sign Up, Profile.
- Routes for `/`, `/signin`, `/signup`, `/profile`.

How to run

1. cd into the project

```bash
cd dashboard/react-app
```

2. Install dependencies and start

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Notes
- Authentication is not implemented — the pages are placeholders. Wire up your auth backend or client state to enable real sign in/up flows.
